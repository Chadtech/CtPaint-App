{-| The canvas html element is a very simple way to render 2D graphics. Check out these examples, and get an explanation of the canvas element [here](https://github.com/elm-community/canvas). Furthermore, If you havent heard of [Elm-Graphics](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-graphics/latest), I recommend checking that out first, because its probably what you need. Elm-Canvas is for when you need unusually direct and low level access to the canvas element.

{-| A `Canvas` contains image data, and can be rendered as html with `toHtml`. It is the primary type of this package.
-}
type Canvas
    = Canvas


{-| Sometimes loading a `Canvas` from a url wont work. When it doesnt, youll get an `Error` instead.
-}
type Error
    = Error


{-| A `Size` contains a width and a height, both of which are `Int`. Many functions will take a `Size` to indicate the size of a canvas region. This type alias is identical to the one found in `elm-lang/window`.
-}
type alias Size =
    { width : Int, height : Int }


{-| -}
type alias Point =
    { x : Float, y : Float }


{-| `DrawOp` are how you can draw onto `Canvas`. To do so, give a `List DrawOp` to `Canvas.batch`, and apply that to a `Canvas`. Each `DrawOp` corresponds almost exactly to a method in the canvas api. [You can look up all the context methods here at the Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D). The biggest exception to the canvas api, is how we handle `ctx.drawImage()`. Since `ctx.drawImage()` can take parameters in three different ways, we made a union type `DrawImageParams` to handle each case.

{-| The `DrawOp` `DrawImage` takes a `Canvas` and a `DrawImageParam`. We made three different `DrawImageParam`, because there are three different sets of parameters you can give the native javascript `ctx.drawImage()`. [See here for more info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawImage.)
-}
type DrawImageParams
    = At Point
    | Scaled Point Size
    | CropScaled Point Size Point Size


{-| `initialize` takes `Size`, and returns a `Canvas` of that size. A freshly initialized `Canvas` is entirely transparent, meaning if you used `getImageData` to get its image data, it would be a `List Int` entirely of 0s.

    squareCanvas : Int -> Canvas
    squareCanvas length =
        initialize (Size length length)
-}
initialize : Size -> Canvas
initialize =
    Native.Canvas.initialize


{-| To turn a `Canvas` into `Html msg`, run it through `toHtml`. The first parameter of `toHtml` is a list of attributes just like the html nodes in `elm-lang/html`.

    pixelatedRender : Canvas -> Html Msg
    pixelatedRender canvas =
        canvas |> toHtml [ class "pixelated" ]
-}
toHtml : List (Attribute msg) -> Canvas -> Html msg
toHtml =
    Native.Canvas.toHtml


{-| This is our primary way of drawing onto canvases. Give `draw` a `drawOp` and apply it to a canvas.

    drawLine : Point -> Point -> Canvas -> Canvas
    drawLine p0 p1 =
        (Canvas.batch >> Canvas.draw)
            [ BeginPath
            , LineWidth 2
            , MoveTo p0
            , LineTo p1
            , Stroke
            ]
-}
draw : DrawOp -> Canvas -> Canvas
draw =
    Native.Canvas.draw


{-| You dont want to apply `DrawOp` one at a time. Bundle many `DrawOp` together in one batch, using `batch`.

    line : Point -> Point -> DrawOp
    line p0 p1 =
        Canvas.batch
            [ BeginPath
            , LineWidth 2
            , MoveTo p0
            , LineTo p1
            , Stroke
            ]
-}
batch : List DrawOp -> DrawOp
batch =
    Batch


{-| Load up an image as a `Canvas` from a url.

    loadSteelix : Cmd Msg
    loadSteelix =
        Task.attempt ImageLoaded (loadImage "./steelix.png")

    update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
    update message model =
        case message of
            ImageLoaded ->
                case Result.toMaybe result of
                    Just canvas ->
                        -- ..

                    Nothing ->
                        -- ..
        -- ..
-}
loadImage : String -> Task Error Canvas
loadImage =
    Native.Canvas.loadImage


{-| `Canvas` have data. Its data comes in the form `List Int`, all of which are between 0 and 255. They represent the RGBA values of every pixel in the image, where the first four `Int` are the color values of the first pixel, the next four `Int` the second pixels, etc. The length of the image data is always a multiple of four, since each pixel is represented by four `Int`.
